    <h1>First Post!</h1>
    <p>This is my first post on this site.</p>
    <h2>Why have I started this site?</h2>
    <p>I wanted a place to document some of the coding I've been doing recently as well as anything else I want to put on here (Recipes, Book reviews, just general thoughts)</p>
    <h2>What I've been up to recently:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Learning C programming using <a href="http://knking.com/books/c2/">"C Programming A Modern Approach"</a> by K.N. King</li>
        <li>Learning to play the flute</li>
        <li>Made ice cream at the weekend (Recipe post TBC)</li>
        <li>Setting up this website!</li>
    </ul>
